# module for wireless driver
#
#
# #Preliminary information
# In order to check the hardware configuration, consider using the following commands
# ```bash
# lspci -nn -v | grep <name>
nc_name=$(lspci -nn | grep --ignore-case "network controller")
info "Network controller is identified as:\n\t$nc_name"
lspci -nn | grep --ignore-case "network controller" | grep "BCM4360" >/dev/null
if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]
then 
		info "Network controller will be handled by this module."
# ```
# **lspci** lists every PCI device with its vendor name (-nn option) and with several verbose modes (-v, -vv, -vvv) according to the level of details needed.
# Using some **grep** will help through a keyword to filter. Keywords are Network, PCI bridge, Audio, and so on.
# Beside we may obtain other general infomation about the machine. DMI or SMBIOS is invoked via
# ```bash
# sudo dmidecode -s <keyword>
# ```
# where keywords are *bios-vendor, bios-version, bios-release-date, system-manufacturer*, and so on.
# For instance
# > sudo dmidecode -s system-product-name
# returns
# > MacBookPro11,3 
# #Wireless Network
# MacBookPro11,3 mounts *Broadcom Limited BCM4360 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter* which is not
# supported by open-source firmware. The appropriate firmware is called *wl* and can be retrieved 
# with third-party software.
# This means that, without a customized debian-installer, it is impossible to do a *netinst*. Of 
# course the *netinst* over a LAN ethernet connection works just fine. Once we installed the 
# system we have to add the Wireless Card firmware.
# We need to check the presence of some apt packages
# ```bash
# sudo apt-get install wireless-tools network-manager-gnome wpasupplicant
# ```
		check_install $un wireless-tools
		check_install $un network-manager-gnome
		check_install $un wpasupplicant
# which, in case of GNOME environment, should all be present.
# We need to add "contrib non-free" to all repos for debian by modifying /etc/apt/sources.list
# and add to each "main" a "main contrib non-free" which allows us to get third-party 
# non-open source software. 
#
